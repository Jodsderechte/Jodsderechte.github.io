So i can either leave it in this semi working state or disable the option completly and have you moving the anchor off screen manually. If your bars keep showing you can always just move them off screen yourself.\n\nQ: My DBM bars keep showing eventhough i have \"hide dbm bars\" enabled?\nA: Using Addonskins together with that option will never work. Also make sure to /reload after updating the aura.\n\nQ: I don't have cooldowntext on my icon like in the gif how do i fix?\nA: You either go to the aura called \"raid ability icon\" there go to the display tab and check the box infront of the text that says %p or you use external addons like OmniCC or Elvui's Cooldown text\n\nQ: Does this work in dungeons?\nA: Yes.
