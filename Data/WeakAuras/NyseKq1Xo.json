Also make sure you have not changed the limit settings for bars. BigWigs -> Bars -> Bars tab -> Visible bar limit (default is 100).\n\nQ: My DBM bars keep showing eventhough i have \"hide dbm bars\" enabled?\nA: Using Addonskins together with that option will never work. Also make sure to /reload after updating the aura.\n\nQ: The timeline used to show Trash mob abilities. Why doesn't it do that anymore?\nA: It was a bug in dbm that they showed at all and that got fixed. If you realy want that make your case [url=https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/issues/5484]here [/url]\n\nQ: I don't have cooldowntext on my icon like in the gif how do i fix?\nA: You either go to the aura called \"raid ability icon\" there go to the display tab and check the box infront of the text that says %p or you use external addons like OmniCC or Elvui's Cooldown text\n\nQ: Does this work in dungeons?\nA: Yes. If your DBM or BW currently works in dungeons, then this WA will too.\n\nQ: How to change the size of the icons\nA: Display tab -> Icon size. \n\nQ: How to move text to the right side\nA: go to display tab press the coghweel on text 1 and change this setting https://imgur.com/a/pI8FtIy . Repeat this for both the icon waiting group and the \"Raid Ability Timeline Icon <10\".\n\nQ: Is there a way to make it horizontal instead of vertical?\nA: The problem with lining up icons horizontally is that there wouldn't be enough room for the spell name text above/below each icon, since the text orientation is always horizontal as well.\n\nQ: How do i get the Icons to look like in the Preview?\nA: If you dislike the default look of icons there are various ways to get icons \"skinned\".
