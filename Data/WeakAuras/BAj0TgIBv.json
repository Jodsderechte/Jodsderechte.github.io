I only use WeakAuras App Companion, not the Wago APP.  I tried your solutions (except the ignore feature as I wanted to fix and continue to get updates of this fine WA of yours) but I was able to get it fixed through something else...\n\nDISCOVERY:\nIt seems that there were still old Auras listed outside of the SL-Dungeons dynamic group that had v154 and v156 SL-Dungeon auras.  It's possible that this may have been updates that were not properly applied and duplicating when I would update to your latest version (your comment about duplicates).\n\nFIX:\nI deleted the SL-Dungeons Dynamic Group AND the separate SL-Dungeons auras that were not part of any dynamic group.  Then I reloaded my UI, then refreshed the WeakAura Companion App and then did another reload.\n\nNext, I reinstalled the latest version SL-Dungeon (156 build) and all of the auras went into the appropriate dynamic group.  I did a reload/refresh/reload and there are no auras outside of their group and most importantly no update notifications.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL:\nWhen I first started using WA, I went crazy with putting auras on and may have installed your current version AND a fork that someone else uploaded.  Over time these may have confused the updates.\n\n- Thank you for your help and keep up the fine work.","format":"bbcode","author":{"name":"rhodan","avatar":{"webp":"https://media.wago.io/avatars/5816cf746cc0c23d3a49d233/b-1631976630768.webp","png":"https://media.wago.io/avatars/5816cf746cc0c23d3a49d233/b-1631976630768.png"},"class":"user-default","profile":"/p/rhodan","enableLinks":false}},{"cid":"630294ee0a04c80ae5c23960","date":"2022-08-21T20:26:22.071Z","text":"[taggeduser]@rhodan[/taggeduser]\n What to do if WeakAuras keep showing Ready for Update auras\nCheck which of WeakAuras Companion and Wago App Companion addons are loaded, do not run both at the same time, refresh auras in app, and restart or type /reload in WoW.\nMouseover the yellow-ish Ready for Update buttons, tooltip show the list of auras it wants to update.\nIf you use duplicates of the same auras weakauras doesn't know which one to update.\nPick a solution:\n- right click on ready-for-update buttons and click Update or Ignore updates\n- find the aura (using Search field on top), go to Information tab, and delete Url field","format":"bbcode","author":{"name":"Jodsderechte","avatar":{"webp":"https://media.wago.io/avatars/5a42986b27a3fb1c863c4f38/u-1657559006320.webp"},"class":"user-goldsub","profile":"/p/Jodsderechte","enableLinks":true}},{"cid":"6302930b1210483e8051c4e9","date":"2022-08-21T20:18:19.882Z","text":"[taggeduser]@Jodsderechte[/taggeduser] Shadowlands-Dungeons keeps telling me that an update is available even though I have the latest version (v1.1.26-156).
