msgid "SkillsDescription"
msgstr "During my studies and in my leisure time, I delved into various programming languages and other relevant topics in software development. I gained proficiency in languages such as Lua and Java. Allowing me to implement diverse algorithms and develop applications with different functionalities. Additionally, I explored web development, learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive and visually appealing websites. <br> <br> Moreover, I familiarized myself with essential tools like Git, enabling version control and collaborative coding. This taught me the importance of teamwork in software projects and the significance of maintaining a well-organized and efficient codebase. Alongside version control, I also honed my skills in SQL, grasping the fundamentals of database design and management. Understanding SQL has been vital in building dynamic applications that interact with databases to store and retrieve information. <br> <br> Overall, my passion for programming drove me to continuously expand my knowledge in the field. Formal education and self-directed learning built a strong foundation in various programming languages and relevant tools, empowering me to tackle complex software projects and contribute effectively to the world of technology. A selection of these skills can be found below."
