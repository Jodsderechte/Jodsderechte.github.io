## 1. What Is a Video Game?  
Think of a video game like an interactive TV show combined with a board game:  
- **Interactive story and challenge.** Players control characters on screen and make decisions in real time.  
- **Skills & teamwork.** Success often depends on quick thinking, strategy, and working with others.  
- **Global competition.** Millions of people play online and compare their performance.

## 2. Introducing Marvel Rivals  
Marvel Rivals is an online “arena” game, somewhat like a virtual sports match, where two teams of six players each select iconic Marvel heroes or villains and battle each other. Key points:  
- **Teams of characters.** Each player picks one hero (e.g. Iron Man, Spider-Man, Wolverine). These characters are strong against some characters and weak against others. In addition these characters work together differently some forming strong bonds while others don't complement each other that well. Think of Thor and Loki working together. 
- **Objectives.** Teams compete to score points, defeat opponents, and secure strategic map zones.  
- **Fast-paced.** Matches last about 10-20 minutes.

## 3. Why Track Statistics?  
Just as scouts and analysts in sports use data to pick top athletes and game plans, RivalsStats provides detailed performance data on which heroes and team setups work best. This helps:  
- **Players improve.** See which characters perform consistently.  
- **Teams strategize.** Understand winning combinations and how to counter opponents.  
- **Broad community insights.** Spot emerging trends before they become mainstream.

| **Best Heroes**       | Rankings of characters by win-rate, pick-rate, and average score.                                              | “Top candidates” list based on performance metrics.                     |
| **Counters**          | Which heroes most effectively defeat (“counter”) a given character.                                            | Identifying a colleague whose skill set fills gaps in another’s profile.|
| **Team Compositions** | Recommended groupings of heroes that work well together (e.g., “Thor + Loki + Hela”).        | Optimal interview panels—people whose strengths complement each other.  |
| **Replay Finder**     | Searchable database of recorded matches, so you can watch exactly how top players used a given hero.           | Reviewing past project recordings or case studies to learn best practices.|

### 4.1 Best Heroes  
- **Win-rate:** Percentage of matches a hero wins.  
- **Pick-rate:** How often players choose that hero.  

**Why it matters:** Just as you’d rely on recruitment metrics (time-to-hire, retention rates), players rely on these numbers to choose the “most hireable” heroes for their team.

---

### 4.2 Counters  
- **Definition:** A “counter” hero has abilities that directly neutralize or outperform another hero.  
- **Example:** If Hero A’s shield breaks Hero B’s attacks, Hero A is a counter to Hero B.

**Why it matters:** In recruitment, you might pair a candidate strong in analytics with someone skilled in stakeholder communication to balance a team—counters work the same way on the battlefield.

---

### 4.3 Team Compositions  
- **Synergy over solo play:** Some heroes have abilities that boost or protect teammates.  
- **Meta compositions:** The “state of the game” evolves; the most successful team lineups change over time.

**Why it matters:** Like putting together a high-performing project team (UX designer + developer + product manager), the right team composition can make the difference between winning and losing.

---

### 4.4 Replay Finder  
- **Search by hero:** “Show me matches where at least one player chose Spider-Man and tried competing against Thor.”  
- **Watch & learn:** Observe how top players move, when they engage or disengage, and how they use abilities in real scenarios.

**Why it matters:** Similar to reviewing recorded interviews or sales calls to refine your approach, watching top “performers” helps you replicate best practices.

RivalsStats is essentially an “analytics dashboard” for Marvel Rivals, helping players (and those who coach them) make smarter decisions—much like modern HR tools help you identify, evaluate, and place top talent.
