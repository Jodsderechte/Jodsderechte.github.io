## What is a video game

Think of a video game like an interactive TV show combined with a board game:  
- **Interactive story and challenge.** Players control characters on screen and make decisions in real time.  
- **Skills & teamwork.** Success often depends on quick thinking, strategy, and working with others.  
- **Global competition.** Millions of people play online and compare their performance.

## What is World of Warcraft?

- **Genre & Scale:** WoW is a massive online role-playing game (MMORPG) where hundreds of thousands of players connect at once.  
- **Character Development:** Each player creates a _character_ (avatar) that levels up by gaining experience, learning new abilities, and collecting better equipment.  
- **Collaboration & Competition:** Players team up to tackle tough challenges or compete against one another, not unlike cross-functional teams collaborating on a complex project.

## Introducing WaCreator

**WaCreator** is a web-based tool that helps World of Warcraft players build and customize **WeakAuras** without writing any code.  
- **WeakAuras** are in-game visual alerts (icons, bars, timers) that track important spells, buffs, debuffs, or fight mechanics.  
- Normally, creating a WeakAura requires navigating a complicated interface, require users to be in game and sometimes even scripting knowledge. WaCreator makes it point-and-click simple.
