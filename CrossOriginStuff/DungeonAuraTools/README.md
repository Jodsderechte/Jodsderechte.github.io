# DungeonAuraTools
Dungeon Aura Tools dynamically creates Dungeon WeakAuras based on user selections to indicate buffs, debuffs, casts, and other relevant information.

Supports all important Dungeon spells and some M+ Affixes.

## Quick Start:
To open the options window, type /jdt or /DungeonAuraTools into your chat and hit enter.

## Options for Changing your Auras when they were generated:

* Icon width and height
* Showing Timers and hiding cooldown Spinners
* Choosing the fonts and text size
* Enable or disable sounds
* X and Y-offset of the groups
* Limit the amount of Auras showing at any given time
* Grow directions and other grow-related options
* Anchoring Auras to the Affix group

Of course, you can always manually adjust the settings on a per Aura level via the normal WeakAuras options!

## Other
