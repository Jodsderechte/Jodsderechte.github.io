## What is a video game

Think of a video game like an interactive TV show combined with a board game:
- **Interactive story and challenge.** Players control characters on screen and make decisions in real time.  
- **Skills & teamwork.** Success often depends on quick thinking, strategy and good team-working. 
- **Competition** People play online and compare their individual performance.

## What is World of Warcraft (WoW)?

- **Genre & Scale:** WoW is a massive online role-playing game (MMORPG) where hundreds of thousands of players connect at once.
- **Character Development:** Each player creates a _character_ (avatar) that levels up by gaining experience, learning new abilities, and collecting better equipment.
- **Collaboration & Competition:** Players team up to tackle tough challenges or compete against one another, not unlike cross-functional teams collaborating on a complex project.
