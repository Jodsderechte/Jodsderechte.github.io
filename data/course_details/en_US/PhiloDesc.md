Viewing computer science as the “engineering science of the mind” (Karl Ganzhorn) naturally reveals interfaces between computer science and philosophy.

The aim of this lecture is to independently work out and identify those interfaces.

### Starting from Kant’s four classic questions:

1. **What ought I to do?**  
2. **What may I hope for?**  
3. **What can I know?**  
4. **What is the human being?**  

Answers are to be sought using the tools of *experimental philosophy*.

These include methods from:

- Game theory  
- Evolutionary games  
- Quantum theory  
- An analysis of humanity’s position “in the crosshairs of the laws of nature”

Participants will gain the competence to develop their own responses to these questions and to defend them with reasoned argument, without needing to claim them as absolute truths.
